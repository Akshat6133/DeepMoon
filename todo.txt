model.py:
1)Need to fix binary cross entropy loss calc so that I dont generate preds twice/iteration. 
2)requirements.txt need to be sharpened. Soo many irrelevant packages. 
3)Write a few unit tests.
4)Generalize README.md
5)Check that you recover the ground truth exactly on the crater unique extract routine.
6)Make code py3 generalizable, maybe tensorflow 1.0 and keras 2.0 as well? Probably isn’t too bad…
